# StrokeSec: Keystroke Dynamics Biometric Security

This project implements a behavioral biometric security system based on keystroke dynamics. It analyzes *how* you type, not just *what* you type, using metrics like Dwell Time and Flight Time.

## Project Structure

- `src/data_collector.py`: Script to capture keystroke timing data.
- `keystroke_data.csv`: The dataset generated by the collector (created after running the script).

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Phase 1: Data Collection

1. Run the collector script:
   ```bash
   python src/data_collector.py
   ```
2. Type the passphrase `helloworld` and hit ENTER.
3. Repeat this 30-50 times to build your profile.
4. Type `quit` and hit ENTER to save and exit.

### Phase 2: Imposter Data

1. Ask a friend to run the same script.
2. Have them type the same passphrase 30-50 times.
3. (Note: You will need to manually label these rows in the CSV later, e.g., add a `label` column where 1=You and 0=Imposter).

## Metrics

- **Dwell Time:** Duration a key is pressed.
- **Flight Time:** Duration between releasing one key and pressing the next.
